 **Custom Migration Script (Local or Azure VM/ACI)**
When to Use
– Early prototyping or one-off migrations.
– Small to medium datasets (e.g., <100,000 records), where time is flexible.
– Need for full control over logic, logging, and error handling.

Pros

Absolute Control: Write the entire migration logic exactly as needed—query Cosmos, write to Blob, delete from Cosmos on success, log every step.

Ease of Debugging: Run interactively, inspect logs, pause/resume as required.

Low Upfront Cost: No additional managed service charges; only pay for compute and egress.

Cons

Operational Overhead: Requires long-running VMs or containers, manual retry logic, and monitoring (not serverless).

No Built-in Scaling: Large datasets may take a long time or require custom parallelism.

No Native Observability: You must build logging, alerting, and reconciliation yourself.

Downtime Risk: If the job fails, you may need to pause and resume, potentially causing operational delays.

Cost

Azure VM/ACI: Pay per second for compute. For large datasets, the total runtime may make this approach more expensive than Azure Functions.

Data Egress: Same as any approach—Cosmos DB and Blob Storage egress rates apply.

No pipeline licensing: No extra managed-service charges.

Best For
Ad-hoc, smaller jobs, or when you need hands-on control for troubleshooting or migration design.

**2. Azure Functions (Serverless)**
When to Use
– Scheduled, ongoing archival of older records (e.g., nightly, weekly).
– Large datasets needing parallelization.
– Production-grade scenarios where reliability, observability, and cost control are critical.

Pros

Serverless: No compute to manage; scales out and down automatically.

Built-in Triggers: Use timer triggers (cron schedule) to run periodically.

Granular Logging: Each function invocation logs success/failure, retries, and progress.

Atomic Operations: Easy to ensure “write to Blob, then delete from Cosmos” happens safely for each record.

Built-in Monitoring: Integrates with Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and dashboards.

Easy Updates: Deploy new versions of your function without downtime.

Cons

Complexity: You must implement and maintain the migration logic yourself.

Timeouts: Functions have execution time limits (default 5 minutes per record batch; can be extended, but not infinitely).

Cold Starts: Occasional latency spikes at small scale.

Failure Recovery: If a function instance crashes, records may not complete; implement retries and dead-letter queues.

Cost

Azure Functions Pricing: Charged per execution (millions of executions per month are inexpensive at low compute/egress). Egress between Cosmos DB and Blob Storage incurs a small cost per GB moved. No pipeline licensing.

Typical Scenario: For a nightly archival of thousands of records, monthly cost is usually negligible.

Monitor: If processing millions of records per day, watch for increased function execution time and egress.

Best For
Production archival, ongoing cost optimization, and scenarios where no downtime and full observability are required.

**3. Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
When to Use
– Bulk, one-time migrations where per-record granularity and atomicity are not required.

Very large datasets (millions of records) needing high throughput.

Scenarios where you want to leverage a managed pipeline tool with built-in retries and monitoring.

Pros

No Coding: Configure via GUI or ARM/Bicep.

Built-in Retry/Alerting: Managed pipeline orchestration with tracking and notifications.

High Throughput: Can copy millions of records in a single job.

Managed Service: No infrastructure to manage.

Cons

Not Atomic: ADF copies data from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage, but does not natively delete source records—you need a second process for this, adding complexity.

No Per-Record Control: Cannot easily enforce “move and delete only on success” for each record.

Pipeline Licensing: ADF charges for pipeline activity and orchestration, increasing cost for recurring jobs.

Not Well-Suited for Ongoing Archival: Designed for batch, not incremental, jobs.

Operational Overhead: Still need a way to delete old records from Cosmos DB.

Cost

Pipeline Runs: ADF charges per pipeline execution and per activity (copy, transform).

Data Movement Units (DMUs): For large datasets, you may need more DMUs, increasing cost.

Pipeline Orchestration: Extra cost for orchestration activities.

Egress: Data transfer costs are the same as other approaches.

Overall: More expensive for ongoing jobs than Azure Functions.

Best For
One-time, large-scale migrations, bulk ingestion, and ETL scenarios—not for incremental, production-grade archival.
